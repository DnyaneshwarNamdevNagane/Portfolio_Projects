# Selected Projects and Outcomes
## Predicting the Patients condition

[Link to "Predicting the patients Condition Project"](https://github.com/DnyaneshwarNamdevNagane/Supervised_learning_project/blob/9b2dd2fb6001a49530f786f00867c55983364524/Patients_condition_prediction_model.ipynb)

* The classification goal is to predict the condition of the patient depending on the received test results.
* Data cleaning and Feature Visualization using matplotlib.
* Used KNN Classifier in the model, GriedSearch_CV for best hyperparameter.
